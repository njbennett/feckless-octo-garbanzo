### bosh stop api

```
```
st+nb $ cf push node

### bosh stop adapter
This only affects syslog-drain, and I'm going to put off fussing with drains for now.

## bosh stop cc-worker
Stops async jobs but I'm not sure how to demonstrate that yet

### bosh stop consul
#### Failing jobs
api
diego-api
scheduler

#### Errors
`cf push` panics -- filed [issue 1351](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/1351) with the cli
Weirdly, `cf apps` works even though the api instance is failing, 
because all that's actually failing is the `routing-api` job
